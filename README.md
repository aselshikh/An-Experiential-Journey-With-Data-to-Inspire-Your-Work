# An Experimental Journey With Data to Inspire Your Work

## Introduction 

The Experiential Journey with Data to Inspire Your Work session will make you think differently about data and how it can solve problems! You will hear surprising use case that will make you think, sometimes laugh and hopefully inspire your own work. The use case and introductory material includes a hands-on experiential journey described below. The most valuable part of this session is that it is designed to help you gain experience and relate it to your work – so that when you leave you have a plan of action on how you can make data more useful in your organization to solve a key challenge.

A real-business application of analytics in “Improving Customer Experiences with Real-Time Insights” will be used as an example during the workshop. This experiential session will include a step by step journey on “How data science is helping IBM to predict the customer experience journey and proactively address the issues, leading to the improvement of Net Promoter Score”. The session will also highlight the importance of using CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) and Agile in Data Science projects.

The methodology involves consuming historical Net Promoter Score (NPS) data; using machine learning and artificial intelligence to identify the most important features and created an algorithm to predict the customer experience.

## Background

NPS has become the industry standard customer loyalty measurement. Businesses see customer experience as an imperative and would like to run analytics on and predict customer experience. Since competition is rife, keeping customers happy so they do not move their investments elsewhere is key to maintaining profitability.

Improving the customer experience is valuable because of its effect on our bottom line. Creating an ultimate experience that appeals to both the heart and the head is our goal. Customers give their money, fans give their hearts of consumers. 44% of consumers say that majority of customer experiences are bland and 69% of consumers say that emotions count for half their experiences.


## Approach

In this notebook, we'll use scikit-learn to predict the customer experience. scikit-learn provides implementations of many classification algorithms. Here, we will apply multiple classification algorithms, evaluate the performance, and select the best peroforming algorithm based on performance metrics.

have chosen the gradient boosting classification algorithm to walk through all the different steps.

To help visualize what we are doing, we'll use 2D and 3D charts to show how the classes look with matplotlib and scikitplot python libraries.
